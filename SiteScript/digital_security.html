        <h1>Digital Security</h1>
        <p>Digital security is the term used to describe all the ways in which you can protect your digital identity.
          Everyone who takes part into processing digital data has responsibility for the securing this data.
          Software developers are responsible for making sure that a system is secured well.
          You can also contribute to your own digital security, for example by using strong passwords.
        </p>
          <p>Protecting this digital information goes by the following three aspects:
          Reliability, keeping data away from unauthorized access.
          Integrity: keeping data safe from loss or unintended changes.
          Accessibility: the ability to access data without errors occuring</p>
        <p>Before access can be granted, it is required to check if the user is supposed to have access. This is called authentication.
          There are different types of authentication, among others something you know (a password), something you have (a key) or something you are (fingerprint scanner, iris scanner). In this example, a key, password, fingerprint or iris are called authentication factors.
          Identification is the process of finding out who the user is, verification is the process of verifying if the user is valid.
          If the user is required to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves, the process is called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA for short,)
        <p>Experts recommend making use of a 3-2-1-system for backup: make sure you always have 3 copies of your data which are stored in at least 2 different ways, of which 1 copy is always stored at a certain location. For example, saving picture on your computer, having printed versions at home and leaving an external hard drive at someone else’s home.
          Encryption is the process of data being converted into code, to keep it from people who are unauthorized to access it. Hashing is similar to encryption, the only difference being that the code can’t be translated back to the original data, which ensures the information can’t be used for bad intentions
